#### This course

We used the following course and the Swirlify package to learn how to make Swirl courses:

**Writing swirl Courses**: An interactive guides and example 
  for swirl course authors. The first group of lessons cover basics. The rest cover 
  special topics useful primarily as samples--points of departure for one's own material.
  For more comprehensive documentation about writing your own swirl courses see http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/.


**Using the Day 0 presentation by Ian Lyttle** as a guideline, we made the general  for lessons

- **Create Package**: Explain steps, install and load required libraries, and create the package itself

- **Create Framework**

- **Develop Package**

- **Test**

- **Documentation**


We are planning question sets for the lessons and will be able to do text, multiple choice, script, etc.
